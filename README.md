# Mobile Systems Security
**LAB 4 _ Prepared by Dr Han Duy Phan**


### Homework: 
You start building a student management system and Android application for your school. 
In this lab 4, you will build a content provider using SQLite database as your data storage to store student information (relational database to store structured student data; this application is like a 'local back-end' providing data for your app in Labs1&2&3). 
To simplify the process of working with database in modern Android development, you don't have to work with SQLite directly. You will use Room persistence library on top of SQLite data storage for your content provider.
